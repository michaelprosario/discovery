As a user, I should be able to add sources to a notebook by simply entering a search phrase or question.
The system should execute a search, return a list of relevant blog posts, and add content sources for each.

===

Given
- I am using an open notebook
- I have started adding sources using the "source search" feature
- I have entered a search term

When
- I press search

Then
- The system appears to start the search operation
- The "add sources from search" operation does not complete
