Given
- I am running src/apps/ingest_notebook_into_vectordb.py
- I have created a notebook on Ben Franklin notes
- I have created a source for for https://www.gutenberg.org/files/20203/20203-8.txt in the notebook

When I invoke the vectordatabase service 
and I ingest data from the notebook 

Then 
- The system does the following work for each source
    1. it segments that source into smaller parts
    2. The segments are stored in the vector database on index "ben_franklink"
    2.5 Each segment should have a embedding associated with it
    3. The system should enable me to trace the parent notebook id and source id on each segment
